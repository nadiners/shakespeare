<p>Can my love excuse the slow offence,<br />
Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,<br />
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?<br />
Till I return of posting is no need.<br />
O what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br />
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br />
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,<br />
In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br />
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,<br />
Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)<br />
Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,<br />
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,<br />
Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,<br />
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.</p>

<h2>64</h2>
<p>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced<br />
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,<br />
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,<br />
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.<br />
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<br />
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<br />
And the firm soil win of the watery main,<br />
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.<br />
When I have seen such interchange of State,<br />
Or state it self confounded, to decay,<br />
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate<br />
That Time will come and take my love away.<br />
This thought is as a death which cannot choose<br />
But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.</p>
