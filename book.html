<h2>51</h2>
<p>Can my love excuse the slow offence,<br />
Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,<br />
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?<br />
Till I return of posting is no need.<br />
O what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br />
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br />
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,<br />
In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br />
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,<br />
Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)<br />
Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,<br />
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,<br />
Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,<br />
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.</p>
