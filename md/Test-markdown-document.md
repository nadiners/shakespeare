Can my love excuse the slow offence,  
Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,  
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?  
Till I return of posting is no need.  
O what excuse will my poor beast then find,  
When swift extremity can seem but slow?  
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,  
In winged speed no motion shall I know,  
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,  
Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)  
Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,  
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,  
Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,  
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced  
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,  
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,  
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.  
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain  
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,  
And the firm soil win of the watery main,  
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.  
When I have seen such interchange of State,  
Or state it self confounded, to decay,  
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate  
That Time will come and take my love away.  
This thought is as a death which cannot choose  
But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
